Frogger Replica by Sabastian Mugazambi

Running the program:
Go into the command prompt and run the python file called 'frogger.py'
As soon as it starts you will see a window that will tell you to get ready. As the game starts the frog starts to move into the traffic and your goal is to use the arrow keys to stop the frog from being hit by a car. 
The arrow keys allow you to go up,down ,left and right at a certain speed that depend on your level

Construction:
I created three classes for all the objects in my frogger world. Frog is a class that keeps track of the frog as its being played by the player.
Bullets is a class that represents the cars and it keeps track of the cars and their movement while being able to return the position of the rectangle of the car. 
Logs class s responsible for keeping track of the logs as they move along with the game. 

So far it is running very slow on a MAC because of hardware issues and the logs are not cliping the frog and moving with the frog.
